## sqlalchemy-challenge
In this assignment, I was asked to retrieve data from a SQLITE database using an ORM (SQLAlchemy) and perform various functions using the ORM. We used additional skills to display this data then route these queries through a Flask server.

## Notes
Constructing queries using an ORM is more difficult to initially set up instead of direct SQL queries as there are layers of abstraction between yourself and the database. However once set up or when the schema and syntax is well understood it is very easy to execute. Once I understood the syntax of SQLAlchemy and how generous it could be the rest of the assignment went more smoothly.

## Future Notes
I was unable to put much time into this assignment so the notation is lacking and I wasn't able to complete the bonus material by the due date. I can continue working on this after submission to central grading.
